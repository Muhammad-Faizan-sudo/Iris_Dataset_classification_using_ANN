# iris-species-classification
- Iris dataset contain three classes: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica
- I used applied Artificial Neural Network or Fully connected layers to train the model for classification of iris species.
- You will how to implement Fully connected layers using Keras (high level wrapper of Tensorflow) and train model which use forward and backward progation algorithm to find the differentiating pattern between these classes.
